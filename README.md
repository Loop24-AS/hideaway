# hideaway

A plugin for [_Interception Tools_][interception-tools] to move the mouse
pointer out of sight after a couple of seconds. The expected parameters are like
follows:

```
hideaway <seconds> <away x> <away y> <back x> <back y>
```

For example, this is to move the mouse away after four seconds, and back from
the bottom right corner to the center of the screen when there's interaction
with the mouse:

```
hideaway 4 10000 10000 -512 -256
```

The `-512 -256` is mouse specific and it's what works for me to put the mouse
pointer back on the screen's center.

## Dependencies

- [Interception Tools][interception-tools]

## Building

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/hideaway.git
$ cd hideaway
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
```

## Execution

`hideaway` is an [_Interception Tools_][interception-tools] plugin. A possible
`udevmon` job configuration is:

```yaml
- JOB: intercept $DEVNODE | hideaway 4 10000 10000 -512 -256 | uinput -d $DEVNODE
  DEVICE:
    EVENTS:
      EV_REL: [REL_X, REL_Y]

```

**Note** that just a single job of this plugin should be running. The previous
configuration will launch a job for any device that responds to `REL_X` or
`REL_Y`, if there's more than one being actively used that does, this will cause
the "hide away" process to happen multiple times. In that case, check the
_Interception Tools_ configuration spec about filtering by device name and other
properties.
